# dynamic_content_on_rim

I've updated the dynamic_content_on_rim library to include features for retrieving fixations mapped to the screen and utilizing the library via CMD.
To set it up for CMD use, first run get_corners_file.py to select the screen corners, resulting in two JSON files. Afterward, you can execute commands via CMD without needing to select the corners again.
